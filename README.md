# Can a Statistician make a smooth transition to Data Scientist?
Since finishing my doctoral degree in biostatistics in 2015, I have wanted to transition from traditional statistics and data analysis to become a data scientist working for a top company. There are many articles that highlight similarities and differences between the two titles. For me, I think the gap is efficient programming skills and working with messier and less predictable data.

According to my [Mango Data Science Radar](https://www.mango-solutions.com/radar/), I am not as much of a Data Wrangler, as I am an effective Modeller and Communicator. I don't necessarily agree, as I have wrangled with my fair share of structured and unstructured data. However, I recognize that I could benefit from more experience in this area.

To close this gap, I have taught myself how to program in both R and Python, relying on help from MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), Youtube, examples here on Github, and many other free resources. I've recently considered entering a program to focus on honing my data science portfolio and to get some help facilitating this career transition in a more structured environment. 

Unlike many other data science career training programs, Insight Data Science provides information on past participants that gives a unique glimpse into what they are looking for in selecting Fellows. Using Python, I scraped the program's web page to assemble a structured data set with information on more than 700 past data science fellows. I summarized the data to compare fellows' information to my own background and interests. Some of the results of my findings are presented here; these discoveries helped me make a decision about applying for the program. The exercise of putting together this summary presented an interesting and insightful data challenge!

## Interesting Findings 
Most fellows studied non-statistical fields in their graduate study. Most frequently, Fellows obtained a doctoral degree in a physics-related field. This finding reminded me that many other disciplines now require rigorous data handling and computation. 

## Future work
I have identified some unstructured data on Fellows from other programs that I hope to compare and combine with these data. I hope to use this information to help other prospective data scientists compare programs and
