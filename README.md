# Insight Data Science Fellows - what does it take?
I created a structured dataset on past fellows using information scraped from the program's webpage. 

## Can a Statistician make the transition to Data Scientist?
According to my [Mango Data Science Radar](https://www.mango-solutions.com/radar/), I am not as much of a Data Wrangler, as I am an effective Modeller and Communicator. INSERT DS RADAR

## Data Science Career Training Programs
As I have researched data science bootcamps, incubators, etc., I have tried to identify what makes a competitive candidate. 

Fortunately, the Insight Data Science program provides information on more than 700 past Fellows. 

In order to organize my thinking, I turned this research into a data science project. 

## Insights
Most fellows studied non-statistical fields in their graduate study. Most frequently, Fellows obtained a doctoral degree in a physics-related field. This finding reminded me that many other disciplines now require rigorous data handling and computation. 


## Future work
I have identified some unstructured data on Fellows from other programs that I hope to compare and combine with these data.
